### Features

 - `Shift click` an explosion to select all available colors for it
 - `Ctrl click` an explosion to clear all selected paints from it
 - `Clear all` - clears every explosion you have selected
 - `Select all` - selects every explosion in every available color
 - `Select owned` - selects every explosion that you have in your inventory
 - `Select favorites` - selects every explosion that you have marked as favorite (this will be available later)

___

Your selection gets stored in between sessions.
The plugin does not work in freeplay only in online matches and private games.
It's client side, so other players will see the goal explosion you have selected in inventory.

The item mod from bakkesmod will be turned on. If you have an active preset, only the goal explosion will be changed.
If you don't want items from the item mod, use an empty preset.

If you want to back up your selection or share it with friends, go into `[bakkesmod_folder]\data\GoalExplosionRandomizer` and copy all files to a safe place or share them with friends.
