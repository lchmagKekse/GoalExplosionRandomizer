Your selection gets stored in between sessions.  
The plugin does not work in freeplay only in online matches and private games.  
It's client side, so other players will see the goal explosion you have selected in inventory.  

The item mod from bakkesmod will be turned on. If you have an active preset, only the goal explosion will be changed.  
If you don't want to see items from the item mod, just use an empty preset.  

If you want to back up your selection or share it with friends, go into `[bakkesmod_folder]\data\GoalExplosionRandomizer` and copy all files to a safe place or share them with friends.
