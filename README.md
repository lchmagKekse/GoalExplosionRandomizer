# GoalExplosionRandomizer

Randomizes goal explosions based on your selection after each goal!

Selection gets stored between sessions. Does not work in freeplay only in actual matches. Its client side so others will only see your selected goal explosion from inventory.

To install manually copy **_GoalExplosionRandomizer.dll_** into **_AppData\Roaming\bakkesmod\bakkesmod\plugins_**

If you have suggestions for improvement or general feedback contact me on discord: **lchmagKekse#7359**
